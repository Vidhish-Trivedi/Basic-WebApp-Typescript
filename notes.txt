DEPENDENCY INVERSSION:
    If a class, say User, wants to work with another class, say CustomMap,
    then User needs to satisfy the requirenments of CustomMap.
    
    TS will implicitly check if a class satisfies the specified interface to be an argument to a method.
    
    NOTE:
        TS also supports the "implements" clause... (just like Java).  // Better practice to use this.
